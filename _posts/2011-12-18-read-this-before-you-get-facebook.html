<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Facebook has introduced timeline feature into its social site. It is more illustrative, chronological listing of posts, photos, shared links, check-ins, and more arrangement than the Facebook profile you’ve been used to. Facebook has enabled a graced period of 7 days for the new Timeline once you have upgraded. Which allows you to check your account and new Timeline before it is revealed to any of your Facebook friends.<br /><br />Facebook wants to make it easier for its users to have faster and better experience of the service. Some group of facebook users complains that the service is not good for them because it will make their account to become vulnerable to social engineering stuffs and others like that (insecurity –ability for hackers to steal information from your social media site).<br /><br />According to the stats, majority of those that are not happy about the new facebook timeline are more than those ones that think the update is natural.<br /><br />What are the benefits of this move, what are you going to get in return for this update and what are you likely to lose by using the service? Most of these things are what I will be talking about below in this article.<br /><br /><br /><b>Advantages:</b><br /><br /><br />The new facebook timeline is a tool that facebook recently launched in order to make it easy for people to have all their information on the same spot without the stress of going from one place to another inorder to get the best of the site. The timeline feature serves just like a normal stream of news on the go! People get latestinformation about what their friends are sharing on the site (videos, images, and others without the need of going to the person’s profile page to view them).<br /><br /><br />Another thing that makes the facebook timeline supreme is, it makes the user’s profile page look more professional than before and allow people to view latest hot news feed better than the formal facebook interface.<br /><br /><br /><b>Disadvantages:</b><br /><br /><br />Number one most dangerous effect the facebook timeline can have on user’s life is mismanagement of personal information. Ifyou do not know how to protect your information online, facebook timeline will be the best place for hackers to steal your information from, so protect it. You need to be wary of this thing because if you do not, something bad may happen and it might hurt you.<br /><br /><br />Mark Zuckerberg says in his speech that you can “tell the whole story of your life on a single facebook page.” The facebook timeline will allow users to put their entire information (lives) on the site.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b><i>Warning: </i></b><br /><br /><b>Did You Review Your Whole Facebook Timeline Before Publishing It?</b><br /><br />Really? <i>The whole thing?</i> You probably didn’t, but <b>you should</b> because there are things you posted long ago that you might not want people to see. I sincerely worry that all over the world, this is happening right now: “Oh look, a new Facebook profile design. Grrr, I dislike change, but it looks cool. There’s a 7 day preview period? But all my friends are showing off their pretty covers. I’ll just publish my Timeline now, and go back and delete <b>embarrassing</b> posts later.” But they won’t. This is a big problem for individuals and Facebook.<br /><br />For the majority of users, things will be fine, and they’ll love Timeline. Facebook did a great job designing it. Maybe too great, such that people publish it too fast. Over the last 6 years, the definition of a Facebook friend has expanded to include people outside one’s peers. Timeline doesn’t change your privacy settings, but it does <i>make it easier for others to find things you posted before you ever friended them.</i><br /><br />I’ve heard Facebook is planning more ways to educate users about the importance of curating your Timeline. There are already a few alerts in the tour, intro, and blog post, but they’re not very <b>strongly</b> worded. That needs to change, and Facebook may need to provide tools to make reviewing the masses of content easier.<br /><br />Once users have already opted in to publishing their Timeline, it will be harder to get them to go back and review. And with today’s global rollout, the time bombs start ticking. Two weeks, a month, a year later, they get a call from their boss about a sexist or racist joke they posted in 2009. They get a call from their mom asking if they have a drinking problem. They get a call from their little brother about whether getting high is fun like they said in that post 3 years ago.<br /><br /><i>Some say you shouldn’t post anything to Facebook you wouldn’t want public. <b>They’re right</b>,</i> but not everyone is so diligent. Beyond the examples above, everyone gets worked up sometimes and writes things that might not seem so appropriate once they’ve cooled down.<br /><br />Facebook needs to get serious about pushing users to vist their Activity Log and review their Timelines. Raising awareness without scaring users will be tough, but Facebook must figure it out. Otherwise, horror stories of lost jobs and family drama are on the way. Burned users will blame Facebook, and the mainstream media will jump all over it.<br /><br />Despite the image above, this isn’t fear mongering or snarky criticism, I’m really trying to help. Facebook, you’ve worked too hard on Timeline to let it become a talking point against you. Tell the users loud and clear how important Timeline review is. Users, tell your friends.<br /><br />Final Verdict:<br />With timeline, you will be able to see your pictures, events, status updates, and much more from your birth up to present moment.<br />It is true that facebook will allow you to enjoy many cool features but the major thing there is the issue of security and some others. You need to protect yourself on the site by making your account private.<br /><br /><br />Click on the title of this post to go to the facebook page and get facebook timeline . . .</div>
