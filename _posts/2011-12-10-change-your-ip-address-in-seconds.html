<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">1. Click on "Start" in the bottom left hand corner of screen<br /><br />2. Click on "Run"<br /><br />3. Type in "command" and hit ok<br /><br />You should now be at an MSDOS prompt screen.<br /><br />4. Type "ipconfig /release" just like that, and hit "enter"<br /><br />5. Type "exit" and leave the prompt<br /><br />6. Right-click on "Network Places" or "My Network Places" on your desktop.<br /><br />7. Click on "properties"<br /><br />You should now be on a screen with something titled "Local Area Connection", or something close to that, and, if you havea network hooked up, all of your other networks.<br /><br />8. Right click on "Local Area Connection" and click "properties"<br /><br />9. Double-click on the "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" from the list under the "General" tab<br /><br />10. Click on "Use the following IP address" under the "General" tab<br /><br />11. Create an IP address (It doesn't matter what it is. I just type 1 and 2 until i fill the area up).<br /><br />12. Press "Tab" and it should automatically fill in the "Subnet Mask" section with default numbers.<br /><br />13. Hit the "Ok" button here<br /><br />14. Hit the "Ok" button again<br /><br />You should now be back to the "Local Area Connection" screen.<br /><br />15. Right-click back on "Local Area Connection" and go to properties again.<br /><br />16. Go back to the "TCP/IP" settings<br /><br />17. This time, select "Obtain an IP address automatically"<br /><br />tongue.gif 18. Hit "Ok"<br /><br />19. Hit "Ok" again<br /><br />20. You now have a new IP address<br /><br />With a little practice, you can easily get this process down to 15 seconds.<br /><br />P.S:<br /><br />This only changes your dynamic IP address,not your ISP/IP address. If you plan on hacking a website with this trick be extremely careful, because if they try a little, they can trace it back</div>
