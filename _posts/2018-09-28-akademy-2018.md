This July I got the opportunity to be a part of the biggest gathering of KDE developers - [Akademy][akademy] [2018][akademy-2018].
It was held in the beautiful city Vienna, Austria from Saturday 11th to Friday 17th August 2018.

The akademy conference as usual has 2 days of talks by KDE contributors 
followed by the rest of the week comprising of BoF informal sessions, team outing etc.

I was a part of the kde containerization [talk][talk]. 
In this talk we discussed various containerization techniques. 
We also demonstrated how containerization of KDE can be useful for developers and end users.


Setting up a development environment for a software can be time-consuming and at times a bit confusing.
There are many libraries and packages that need to be installed and which might also cause conflict with the existing system packages.
There are various ways to containerize an application, we will discuss two major approaches - Docker and Flatpak.
Docker helps a developer by setting up a sandboxed development environment in a container which can be used for debugging, testing or developing a new feature.
You can run multiple such environments in parallel e.g. stable & development environment.
Flatpak provides a sandbox environment in which users can run applications in isolation from the rest of the system. 


BoF stands for birds of feather sessions. <!-- TODO: Add more -->
For example in KDE India BoF, we talked about <!-- TODO: Add about india bof -->
