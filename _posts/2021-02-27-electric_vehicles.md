With global carbon emissions on the rise, electric cars are the future.
Tesla might have first-to-market advantage, but it is not the only savior and by all metrics it is highly overvalued.
Ford and GM are the biggest competitors with multiple electric vehicles coming out soon.

Ford is coming out with its extremely famous F150 but all electric model by end of 2021.
GM plans to sell all-electric by 2035.
Ford plans to be all electric in Europe by 2030.
Several other successful auto-makers with a proven track record have plans to build more and more electric vehicles - Daimler/Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Jaguar.

According to Navigant Research, Ford and GM are among the leaders in the race for autonomous vehicle tech.
TSLA has hype on its side, F & GM have experience, scale, higher earnings/profits and likely the tech too.

Google’s Waymo has teamed up with Chrysler and it is targeting ride-hailing market, already offering driverless rides in Arizona.
Apple is teaming with Hyundai but it’s still years from production.

Battery energy density is the biggest hurdle to successfully replacing fossil fuel powered vehicles.
It becomes impractical to build large/high-range electric vehicles because the weight of battery packs just makes the vehicle too heavy.

The Economics of Tesla’s Batteries Business
Tesla is breaking ground in electric cars, solar panels, and clean energy storage. Here's a closer look at the economics of Tesla batteries.

To make a practically successful electric vehicle, you need to match the range that gas-powered vehicles provide.
Gas-powered vehicles might be less efficient at utilizing the fuel completely but equivalent battery cells required for same range weigh a lot more.

Panasonic is the leading battery cell manufacturer and energy-density is a limitation that all EV car manufacturers face.
That’s the reason why major breakthrough EV adoption has been in the short-to-medium range vehicles and why long-haul electric truck manufacturing is harder.

No one wants to wait for an hour every few 100 miles, so you need more charging stations and to charge batteries faster.
Charging stations cost a lot of money to build, making it difficult to cover larger areas. Lack of a standard charging plug is no help.

Nio has approached this from a different angle in China - Battery-as-a-Service.
They are building cars with battery-swapping capability and charging-stations that can swap battery pack in just 5 mins.
It has already completed a million swaps by Q4’2020.

It is a hot space with a lot of hype and competition soon, but there are several other areas that need innovation to make electric cars the de-facto choice.
Tesla doesn’t have all the answers to the problems our planet faces. It is one of many and we need more innovation, sooner!
