<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I’m a rare AB+ with only around 3% of the world’s population in this category. It is also the last blood type to be identified so it’s the ‘newest’ in a sense. I’ve heard about eating for your blood type before from cousins and haven’t really given much thought to it except that it’s all rubbish and a balanced diet is what’s important.<br />But curiosity got the better of me and I started looking around for information and cam across many articles, as one would expect with Google. Here’s what I’ve learned:<br />*AB+ blood types have low stomach acid levels so we can’t digest large portions of meat very well … turkey and lamb in small portions are the best options OR solid tofu (this is a bummer because I do enjoy a good steak)<br />Note: chicken is not good because high levels of lectin irritate stomach (… and there goes my favorite cuisine !)<br />*Smaller regular meals through the day better than large meals because low level of stomach acid means we are slower to digest (good news but must remember the key word here – SMALLER, not regular)<br />*We should avoid carbonated beverages … dammit, there goes my enjoyment of vodka, lime, soda … then again, it also says avoid alcohol (not happening)<br />*Finally some good news: we do well on grains! At least I can continue my mundane but satisfying affair with brown rice and oats.<br />*It also says we do well with dairy but this is contrary to my low level lactose intolerance<br />Based on a lot of the advice from different sites around half of what I eat is not suited to my blood type!<br />Most advice from doctors and scientists agree eating for your blood type is nonsense and there is no link there. So. while it was interesting to read about a different approach and theory about diet I’ll continue to enjoy my chicken and try to stick to a balanced diet.</div>
