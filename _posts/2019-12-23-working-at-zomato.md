### Trial Week
Applied and was rejected in online coding round.
It was heart-breaking, especially when you're just getting out of college and don't have a job you really wanted.
Don't be discouraged by failures and continuously work on your craft.
It turns out I'll later conduct interviews for Zomato online & across nation in IITs).

I went to do my 6 month internship at Thoughtworks.
I feel like getting rejected was a good thing in hind-sight.
It made me hungry, made me want to learn more and more.
I started focusing on competitive coding to sharpen the touch I had lost and started working on mini startupish app ideas with my friends.
...  
I learned all that I could learn about Android working on a healthcare robot at Thoughtworks.
