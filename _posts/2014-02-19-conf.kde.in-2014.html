<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Sadly I wasn't able to report it live, partly due to bad internet coverage and Blackberry not being on my side.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Well let's start then, actually the start itself was pretty amazing. I met Vishesh Handa for the first time in the flight itself. I reached Ahemdabad around 2100hr, &nbsp;to be frank first day was really</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>23:33:14 &nbsp;Wed Feb 19, 2014: </b>Journey starts tomorrow morn. Expectations are high. I'll blog about it here and also tweet with #confkdein.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>00:20:34 &nbsp;Thu Feb 20, 2014:</b> Just mailed kde-multimedia to share some videos. I think it will look really cool if I'm able to pull it off. Just packed. Google tells me that weather in gandhinagar will be around &nbsp;30°C. That's actually kinda hot because their minimum(17°C) is like the maximum temperature we see here in Chandigarh.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Thu Feb 20: </b>Believe it or not I worked on my slides while I was waiting for the flight.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>1930hr Thu Feb 20:</b> I met <a href="http://vhanda.in/" target="_blank">Vishesh Handa</a> for the first time in the flight itself. Call it coincidence but he had the same filght and even more we were in the same row. So the begining was itself awesome. We talked about my Season of KDE project during the flight and finally reached Ahemdabad.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>2140 Thu Fed 20:</b> It was hot, pretty hot as compared to Chandigarh. Members from organising team were already there with a ride. The roads looked pretty good. We covered 15-20 km very quickly. We checked into the hotel. I shared room with <a href="http://rishab.in/" target="_blank">Rishab</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SayantanKnz" target="_blank">Sayantan</a>.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>2200 Thu Feb 20:</b>&nbsp;2200 was actually pretty late for a city like Gandhinagar (maybe because Gujarat is a '<i>dry state</i>'). All the shops were closed. Organizers were really very sweet actually, they called a lot of guys to figure out a place for us to eat. Finally we settled for Subway.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>0000-0200 Fri Feb 21:</b> The room was nice. We all gathered into one room. I met <a href="http://www.shantanutushar.com/" target="_blank">Shantanu</a>, <a href="http://sujithh.info/" target="_blank">Sujith</a>, <a href="http://who828.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Smit</a> there. We talked for quite some time about random stuff. Once I came back into the room I finally had the chance to look at the schedule. I was really very tired but I still worked a little bit on the slides and finally went to sleep.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>1000 Fri Feb 21:</b> Next morning, aha, conf.kde.in. I met <a href="https://twitter.com/pradeepto" target="_blank">Pradeepto</a>, <a href="http://sinny.in/" target="_blank">Sinny</a> and a lot of other guys during breakfast. Then we all went to the venue DAIICT. Damn such a cool campus man. It was amazing.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bI4z2wQSgp0/U1wOSU2ssnI/AAAAAAAADS8/cJerLW0RI18/s1600/IMG_5785.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bI4z2wQSgp0/U1wOSU2ssnI/AAAAAAAADS8/cJerLW0RI18/s1600/IMG_5785.JPG" height="213" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>1400 Fri Feb 21: </b><a href="http://conf.kde.in/">conf.kde.in</a> officially started with inauguration speech by&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/pradeepto" target="_blank">Pradeepto</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.yashshah.com/" target="_blank">Yash</a>.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>1500 Fri Feb 21:</b> <a href="http://www.prashanthudupa.com/" target="_blank">Prashanth</a> started the Qt workshop, at first I was like what, QApplication, QLabel. but then I soon realized that there are a lot of newbie in the crowd, so we went from one seat to other to help them understand and debug their issues.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><table><tbody><tr><td><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>2000 Fri Feb 21: </b>We all went to this place called Sam's pizza. I went to the one here in Chandigarh and trust me I only recommended it to my worst enemies. But anyway we enjoyed it. Those moments were more delicious than that rock hard papad like pizza.</div></td><td><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ndw-9ui9v3w/U1wPt-pF4vI/AAAAAAAADTE/1-0vzDhUASg/s1600/IMG_6096.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ndw-9ui9v3w/U1wPt-pF4vI/AAAAAAAADTE/1-0vzDhUASg/s1600/IMG_6096.JPG" height="426" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: right;"><br /></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>2200 Fri Feb 21:</b> We met some of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.yashshah.com/" target="_blank">Yash</a>'s friends. Had a little party at their place and finally reached back around&nbsp;2300hr. Wifi was still not working so we complained the manager about it(again).</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>0100 Sat Feb 22:</b> Don't ask how but we somehow gained access and figured out the details of our account, but luck was still not on our side. The only room in the entire hotel which didn't have any signal strength was the one where we were staying.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left;"><br /><b>Sat Feb 22: </b>&nbsp;I never had stage fear, but the thing is you're never fully prepared. There was a lunch break before my talk so that made the things little more tense in my mind. It finally started and the worst part was that I had to run windows because sadly no matter how awesome Libre Office gets with each update, still it just can't beat MS Office. One of the few reasons why I keep windows on my laptop. Anyway the audience was awesome. I had a quiz in my slide and the participation was really really very good. Also I will not forget the responses I got from the team members. Thank you guys.<br /><br /><b>1900 Sat Feb 22: </b>Tired and extremely exhausted we head back to the hotel only to realize that there was one more place still left on our checklist.<br /><br /><b>2000 Sat Feb 22: </b>We went to this place called <a href="http://www.rajwadu.com/" target="_blank">Rajwadu</a> -&nbsp;a theme based restaurant spread over 12,000 sq. yards represents ancient culture and lifestyle of villages in Gujarat/India. The entry, setup, bonfire, dance show and whatnot. Every thing was full on Gujarati style. It was an eye-catching. The size of the thalli (plate), OMG, it was huge. The aroma ah, just amazing. The food was awesome. I really loved it.<br /><br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KbZGhaEAU7k/U1wImiZcaMI/AAAAAAAADSI/HgEeOwZvhjg/s1600/IMG_7240.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KbZGhaEAU7k/U1wImiZcaMI/AAAAAAAADSI/HgEeOwZvhjg/s1600/IMG_7240.JPG" height="133" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Look at the size of that plate/thalli</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4nJAoVs_LXk/U1wIrMJ5E9I/AAAAAAAADSQ/n349ysetHhU/s1600/IMG_7230.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="display: inline !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4nJAoVs_LXk/U1wIrMJ5E9I/AAAAAAAADSQ/n349ysetHhU/s1600/IMG_7230.JPG" height="212" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">No chair sofas, sit cross legged and enjoy</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><b>Sun Feb 23:</b>&nbsp;I was done with my talk so I was feeling like a free bird.<br /><br /><br /></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bMBOkixGUNs/Ux-VCWlfWCI/AAAAAAAADLk/rM9vN65fBdE/s1600/WorkInProgress%255BMallet%255D.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bMBOkixGUNs/Ux-VCWlfWCI/AAAAAAAADLk/rM9vN65fBdE/s1600/WorkInProgress%255BMallet%255D.gif" height="300" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nCxKBhvNUxs/Ux-VChji8CI/AAAAAAAADLY/0qKNzthhsBc/s1600/tumblr_m3nheedxtp1qz4arno1_500.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nCxKBhvNUxs/Ux-VChji8CI/AAAAAAAADLY/0qKNzthhsBc/s1600/tumblr_m3nheedxtp1qz4arno1_500.gif" height="301" width="400" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div></div>
